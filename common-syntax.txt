Syntax:

(sexp shasdfla alsdkf (asd
    (sladf asdlf)))

    #;Line comments
    #; like this

 #![ internal directive]
 #![internal (subdir directive)]

#[ external directive   ]

#(commented (out
    s-expression (which
        #(can be (nested)))))

#| Block comment, which can #|also|# be nested#||#   |#

#|Any code can be commented out by a block comment or a commented sexp.
(this includes if #(you are dumb and #; )))))) #| #| #| #|#|#| have a line comment
    containing comment delimiters) #; which are thereby ignored. #( #( #(#(
    So don) #; 't do that.
 Also, block comments can hold unbalanced sexp delims #(#(#( ... etc. Syntax not cked. |#

Differences between block comments and commented-sexprs:
- Commented sexprs are still lexed, intended to be valid code. OTOH, block comments are fully free-for-all, save for line comment introductions, line endings, begin and end block delimiters.
- Similarly but more simply, line commments are anything-goes except a newline (or other vertical whitespace).

State machine for block comments:
upon seeing #| tok:
    while true:
        if find a #; :
            scan till eol
        if find a #| tok:
            recursive call to self
        if find a |# tok:
            return

Ident: any a-z, A-Z, -, _, and non-initial 0-9, ' sequence.

When need is demonstrated, add numbers and strings.
